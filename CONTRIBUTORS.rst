Introduction
============

This file contains an incomplete list of contributors to ``buhmm``. It is
intended to be an *inclusive* list. So anyone who has contributed and wishes
to make that contribution known is welcome to add an entry into this file. As
a rule, no name should be added to this list without the approval of the person
associated with that name.

In general, creating a comprehensive list of contributors can be difficult, and
the list within this file is almost certainly incomplete.  Contributors include
testers, bug reporters, build/integration systems (such as `TravisCI <https
://travis-ci.org>`_, `coveralls <https://coveralls.io>`_, and `readthedocs
<https://readthedocs.org>`_), contributors who wish to remain anonymous,
funding sources, academic advisors, users, etc.

Do you want to make your contribution known? If you have commit access, edit
this file and add your name. If you do not have commit access, feel free to
open an `issue <https://github.com/chebee7i/buhmm/issues/new>`_ or get in
contact with someone who does have commit access.

A supplementary (but still incomplete) list of contributors is given by the
list of names that have commits in ``buhmm``'s `git <http://git-scm.com>`_
repository. This can be obtained via::

    git log --raw | grep "^Author: " | sort | uniq
